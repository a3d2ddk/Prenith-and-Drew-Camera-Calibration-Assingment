create a gradio based UI that has a textbox for uploading the images for a camera, 5 buttons, one for processing the data, one for running camera calibration, one for visualizing the poses, one for displaying coordinate systems on the images, another one to run camera distortion.
Keep the code to minimal, with seperation between classes, like Cam (camera clibration), Img (operation, read, write, bgr_to_clr, resize image), Render(draw coordinate system, visualize the poses, etc), IO (file loading utilities).

Give me a very consise readme file based on my code
